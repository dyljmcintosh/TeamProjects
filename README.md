# TeamProjects
This repository will hold builds and some source material from team projects I have worked on

# Dead Quiet
Dead quiet is built to be played by 2 players on PS4 controllers. It has no keyboard and mouse support.

# Manufacture Breakdown
A tower defense game, click on the lit tiles to place a tower. You can go level by level in a continous mode or play each level individually.

# Ghostly Revenge
A set of rules in a rulebook, a quick start guide and a design document we followed. I own the only physical copy of it.


Everything displayed is to be viewed as assessment for hiring and not altered or copied.
